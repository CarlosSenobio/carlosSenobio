### Greetings, Iâ€™m Carlos ðŸ§ 

Iâ€™m a **Physics student** â€” because understanding the laws of the universe is just the beginning.  
Iâ€™m also a **full-stack, mobile, and AI developer**, where code meets cosmos (fueled by coffee â˜•).

Iâ€™m the **Co-founder & CTO at Axisor Technologies Brazil**, where I lead cutting-edge solutions that flirt with the future (no DeLorean required... yet).

If this repository seems a bit quiet, don't worry. Just like quantum particles, the real action happens where you can't see it â€” in private repos and late-night breakthroughs.
