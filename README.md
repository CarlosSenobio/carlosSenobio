### ðŸ‘‹ Greetings, Iâ€™m Carlos

Iâ€™m a **Physics student**, because unraveling the laws of the universe is just my warm-up routine.  
Also an **AI researcher and model developer**, where neural networks meet natural laws â€” powered by a dangerously consistent caffeine intake â˜•.

ðŸš€ **Co-founder & Chief AI Scientist at Axisor Technologies Brazil**, where I design models, explore novel architectures, and shape the future of intelligent systems â€” no DeLorean needed (yet).

> _If things look calm around here, donâ€™t worry. Like a neutrino or a clever idea, the real activity happens beneath the surface â€” in private repos, research drafts, and late-night breakthroughs._
