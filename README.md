### Greetings, I’m Carlos 🧠

I’m a **Physics student** — because understanding the laws of the universe is just the beginning.  
I’m also a **full-stack, mobile, and AI developer**, where code meets cosmos (fueled by coffee ☕).

Currently serving as **CTO at Axisor Technologies Brasil**, I lead cutting-edge solutions that flirt with the future (no DeLorean required... yet).

If this repository seems a bit quiet, don't worry. Just like quantum particles, the real action happens where you can't see it — in private repos and late-night breakthroughs.

Physics is my foundation, tech is my playground… and genius?  
I’ll let you be the judge. 😉

**Bazinga!** 🧪
